# Rust Journey

The way I always learned new programming languages was to dive straight into whichever problem/project that required me to use that language, and to simply start writing code, googling my way through any obstacles I find along the way.

Currently, I'm learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), this repo will serve as a record of my progress, and also as a place to share the small projects I'm working on (to learn Rust).
